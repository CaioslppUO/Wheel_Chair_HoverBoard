# Material needed to do:
   
   Here we put a list to assemble the circuit in the simplest way, 
     with only 2 wheels and a main board(it also can be done with only 1 wheel):
     
     * 1 mainBoard, removed from the hoverBoard.
     * 2 Or 1 wheel(s), depending on what you want, removed from the hoverBoard.
     * A 36-40 volts baterry (we use the default hoverBoard battery)
     * A couple of wires to connect the circuit.
     * A nintendo nunchuck
     * A programmer ST-LINK/V2
     * A an ordinary wheel chair

# Tutorial:
   
   * 1 - Setup the main Hover Board.
   
      * Follow instructions under src/mainBoard/.     
      
   * 2 - Setup all the circuits needed to make it work.
   
      * Follow instructions under pictures/circuits/mainBoard , pictures/circuits/mainCircuit and
        pictures/circuits/whells/.  
   
   * 3 - Control the wheel chair.
